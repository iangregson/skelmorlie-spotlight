## COMING SOON
> Still very much under development. Hopefully going live in early 2017.

**What is it?**
A web app that will turn a number of RSS / atom feeds into a news ticker for the Skelmorlie area using my 
['scruffy'](https://github.com/iangregson/scruffy "Scruffy github") package.
The first release will show the most recent items then I'll follow up with a Hacker news style toggle between recent and popular.
